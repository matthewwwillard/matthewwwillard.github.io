<p id="aboutBlerb" class="centerText mb-4">
    <b>Programming is my passion, hobby and career</b>. I started my journey back in 1999, writing my first 'Application' in <b>QBasic</b> on a garbage picked computer.
From there, it's only grown. I've held multiple positions, from Jr Programmer, Senior Programmer, Dev Lead, Lead System Architect, to my current position,
    Senior Backend Developer & System Administration. I <b>love</b> the industry, and I love <b>creating</b>.
