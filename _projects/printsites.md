### What I Did

* Rewrite entire backend
* Create new API
* Created new Database Schema and Architecture
* Create Super Moderation Panel for managing clients and sites (Ground Control)
* Client Level Moderation Panel for managing print options and pricing (Store Front Admin)

Sadly, ISource Worldwide/PrintSites has closed. The product was near completion for commercial release. I was brought on to help deprecate the old PHP application.
